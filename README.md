A web app using Vue and a PostgreSQL database that allows users to plan and construct an itinerary of a tour of famous European cities like Barcelona or Brussels. 
Logged in users can create itineraries by constructing a list of landmarks in their chosen city that they are interested in visiting. 
Users can create multiple itineraries which can then be saved, edited or deleted.
